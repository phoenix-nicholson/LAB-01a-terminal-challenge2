# About me

Here are **three** things about me:
* I have a dog named Miklo
* I live in Northern California
* My favorite show is the anime One piece

to declare a variable in Javascript we use the keyword `let`

This is an example of fat arrow functions in Javascript:
```js
const myFunc = () => {
    console.log("my function!");
}
```
